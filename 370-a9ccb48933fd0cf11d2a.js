In some cases, you may need to support locales outside of the ones we provide by default. This is possible, however one must ensure the locales are supported by `react-intl`, otherwise no locale-data will exist and loading the intl data will result in an error. Once confirmed that the locale is supported by `react-intl`, one is responsible for including the appropriate translations messages for each terra component used in your application, otherwise the translations will fail and `react-intl` will display the message name as the fallback.\n\nAs an example, let's say you need to support Polish (`pl`) in your app.\n\nIn the aggregate translation functions, set the locales option and include the `pl` locale.\n\nIf you only need to support English and Polish, you can call `aggregateTranslations` function with the following:\n\n```js\nconst aggregateTranslations = require('terra-aggregate-translations');\n\naggregateTranslations({ locales: ['en', 'pl']});\n```\n\nIf you want to support all of the Terra UI supported locales in addition to Polish, you can call `aggregateTranslations` function with the following:\n\n```js\nconst aggregateTranslations = require('terra-aggregate-translations');\nconst supportedLocales = require('terra-aggregate-translations/config/i18nSupportedLocales.js');\n\n\naggregateTranslations({ locales: [...supportedLocales, 'pl']});\n```\n\nSimilarly, if leveraging [Terra UI's default webpack configuration](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit/blob/master/config/webpack/webpack.config.js), [you can add a `terraI18n.config.js` file to the root of your project with options to pass to aggregate-translations when its called](https://github.com/cerner/terra-aggregate-translations#terrai18nconfig-example).\n\n**Note** *When aggregating a locale not supported by Terra UI, you will see two types of warning messages*\n\n```\nWARNING: pl is NOT a Terra supported locale. Creating an aggregate translation file for pl, but be sure to include the appropriate translations messages for each terra component used in your application otherwise the translations will fail and the fallback will be displayed.\n```\n\nThe above message is a general warning from the `aggregateTranslations` function reminding you to include translations for the unsupported Terra UI locale you are adding.\n\n```\nThere was an error reading your translations file /Users/MyComputer/repos/terra-sandbox/node_modules/terra-alert/translations/pl.json.\n\nException Message: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/MyComputer/repos/terra-sandbox/node_modules/terra-alert/translations/pl.json'\n```\n\nThe above message is a general warning that occurs for each Terra UI component your app uses noting that it does not provide translations for the locales you are adding beyond the default locales supported by Terra UI.\n\nTo resolve these warnings after running the aggregate-translations tool, you will need to add the terra name-spaced translation keys with the correct translations as a `.json` file for each non-supported locale in your app's translations directory.\n\nWe recommend copying all of terra name-space translations keys found in the `aggregate-translations/en.js` file as the basis for your new translations file. This will be a compiled list of the terra component translations used in your app.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nsrc/\n  ↳ MyComponent.jsx\ntranslations/\n  ↳ en.json\n  ↳ es.json\n  ↳ pl.json // Includes all keys from aggregate-translations/en.js in polish translations, in addition to your custom translations\n```"}}]);
