This means the padding and border of the parent container is included in the available width.\n\n### New Features\n\n* Added an `onChange` callback function that is invoked when a breakpoint range changes to enable creating controlled responsive elements.\n* Added an `onResize` callback function that is invoked when the responsive target triggers a resize event.\n* Added `children` as a prop to use in conjunction with `onChange` to create controlled components.\n\n### Breakpoint Changes\n\nThe breakpoint ranges have all shifted. This change was made to remove the ambiguous breakpoint range in-between 0 and tiny. Previously tiny started at 544px. The range from 0 to 543px had no associated breakpoint. It was considered the default size. Tiny now starts at 0.\n\n| Breakpoint | Previous | Updated |\n|---|---|---|\n| tiny | 544 - 767 | 0 - 543 |\n| small | 768 - 991 | 544 - 767 |\n| medium | 992 - 1215 | 768 - 991 |\n| large | 1216 - 1439 | 992 - 1215 |\n| huge | 1440 - ∞ | 1216 - 1439 |\n| enormous | -- | 1440 - ∞ |\n\nTo upgrade, shift all declared breakpoint props by one breakpoint. During this uplift it is recommended to consider implementing a controlled version of the responsive element using the `children` and `onChange` props that have been added. Examples can be found on the doc site.\n\n* defaultElement -> tiny\n* tiny -> small\n* small -> medium\n* medium -> large\n* large -> huge\n* huge -> enormous\n\nThe `breakpoints.scss` file has been removed. Any files previously referencing `breakpoints.scss` should import the new values provided by [terra-breakpoints](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/#/components/terra-breakpoints/breakpoints/about).\n\n### Examples\n\n```diff\n- <ResponsiveElement defaultElement={<div />} large={<div />} />\n+ <ResponsiveElement tiny={<div />} huge={<div />} />\n```\n\n```diff\n- <ResponsiveElement tiny={<div />} huge={<div />} />\n+ <ResponsiveElement small={<div />} enormous={<div />} />\n```\n\n## Changes from 3.0 to 4.0\n\n### Changes to CSS Custom Properties\n\nThe following transitive dependency had breaking changes.
