The [terra-enzyme-intl](https://github.com/cerner/terra-enzyme-intl) package will use the translation keys for the translation strings instead of the actual translations. If you want to test the actual translation string values, we recommend testing translations with a tool like webdriver.io.\n\n## Changes from 2.0 to 3.0\n\n### Changes to CSS Custom Properties\n\nThe following transitive dependency had breaking changes.
