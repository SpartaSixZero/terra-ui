The aggregate translations tool will look for translations in [the following directories](https://github.com/cerner/terra-aggregate-translations/blob/master/config/defaultSearchPatterns.js) by default. The default search pattern will look for translations a maximum of three levels deep.\n\nHere is an example directory setup:\n\n```\nsrc/\n  ↳ MyComponent.jsx\ntranslations/\n  ↳ en.json\n  ↳ es.json\n```\n\nHere is an example translation file.\n\n```json\n{\n  "myApp.componentName.error": "Error.",\n  "myApp.componentName.warning": "Warning.",\n  "myApp.componentName.success": "Success."\n}\n```\n\nTranslations must be included for each locale the app intends to support. At a minimum, apps must include `en` translations as it is intended to be the fallback locale for terra-base.\n\nTranslation keys should be namespaced and unique to prevent translation key collision from other dependencies.\n'}}]);
