By default the dev service volume mounts the entire local repo directory into the docker container to enable hot reloading during development.\\n\\n#### Term Service\\nThe term service behaves like the dev service, but will launch the zsh terminal instead of starting the server. You can use this terminal just like you would use your local terminal.\\n\\n#### Standalone Chrome Service\\nTerra's webdriver.io integration tests must run against selenium standalone-chrome node, so this service is required to run wdio tests. It is started alongside both the dev and term services.\\n\\n### Sharing ```node_modules```\\nThe docker development environment intentionally will write out ```node_modules``` to the shared host volume. This provides several benefits:\\n* Simpler volume mounting, everything edited in the repo is shared to the docker container.\\n* Node module cacheing. For the development containers ```npm install``` is run at run time of the docker container (opposed to build time). This is done to allow ```npm install``` to discover local dependencies. To avoid long startup times ```node_modules``` are cached to the local volume. If ```node_modules``` are found ```npm install``` is not run at run time.\\n\\n### Before Development\\nTo build all the services in the docker-compose file, run:\\n```\\ndocker-compose build\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Develping\\nTo get started developing with the dev service, run:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker-compose run --service-ports dev\\n```\\n\\nThis will start the docker container for the repo, run npm install (if ```node_modules``` are not detected) and start the dev server using ```npm run start```. Then you're free to use your favorite editor to manipulate the code in the repo.\\n\\nOR, to develop with the term service, run:\\n```bash\\ndocker-compose run  --service-ports term\\n```\\n\\nThis will start the docker container for the repo, run npm install (if ```node_modules``` are not detected) and then launch the zsh terminal. Simply run ```npm run start``` once the terminal has launched to start the server.\\n\\n### Testing\\nIt is required to use the ```--service-ports``` flag when running either service to run wdio tests from the docker container. This maps the service's ports to the host.\\n\\n\\n### After development\\nAfter you've finished running development (or periodically), run:\\n```bash\\ndocker-compose down\\n```\\nThis will stop the standalone-chrome service that will otherwise be left running on your device.\\n\\n\\n### Using Local Dependencies\\nLocal dependencies are supported in the docker development environment, but require an additional step. For the docker container to be able to find the local dependency, it must be volume mounted to the docker container from the dev service.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\npackage.json\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"classnames\\\": \\\"file:../classnames\\\",\\n}\\n```\\n\\ndocker-compose.yml\\n```diff\\ndev:\\n  image: \\\"terra-ui:dev\\\"\\n  build:\\n    context: ./\\n    args:\\n      - npm_install=false\\n  ports:\\n    - 8080:8080\\n  volumes:\\n    - .:/opt/module\\n+    # This is the local dependency volume mount.\\n+    - ../classnames:/opt/classnames\\n```\\n\\n### Other Ways to Run the Zsh Terminal\\nThere a couple of additional methods of running the terminal on the docker container. Either run a terminal through docker-compose or use docker to attach to a running docker image.\\n\\nTo launch to the terminal on the dev image, run:\\n\\n```\\ndocker-compose run --service-ports dev /bin/zsh\\n```\\nTo attach to a running docker container, run:\\n\\n```\\ndocker exec -it <hash for running docker container> /bin/zsh\\n```\\n\\n### Troubleshooting\\n#### Error: Missing binding\\nThis error means that a node_module install for one environment is being run in another. Likely this means that you ran npm install on your host OS and are now trying to use that module in your docker container or the opposite. To resolve the issue delete the ```node_modules``` folder and run npm_install where you are attempting to start the server.\\n\\n#### Dependency changes not taking effect.\\nnpm install is triggered at run time of the docker container. If a ```node_modules``` directory is found npm install will not run. If dependencies have changed the script checking for ```node_modules``` isn't smart enough to re-run npm install. To resolve the issue either term servcie and run npm install or delete the ```node_modules``` folder and rerun the docker container.\\n\""],"sourceRoot":""}
